# Scanning Logic Options

## Option 1: Ultra-Fast Minimal Scanning
**Strategy**: Only scan when user selects Subject + Year (minimum required)
**Performance**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (Fastest)
**User Experience**: ⭐⭐⭐ (Requires specific input)

```javascript
// Only triggers when both Subject AND Year are selected
// Scans exact path: questions/Subject/Year/*/
// Ultra-targeted, minimal file checks
```

**Pros:**
- Extremely fast scanning
- Minimal server requests
- Very targeted file checks
- Clear user guidance

**Cons:**
- Requires users to select Subject + Year first
- Can't browse by single filter
- Less flexible exploration

---

## Option 2: Progressive Smart Scanning
**Strategy**: Intelligent scanning based on filter hierarchy
**Performance**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (Very Good)
**User Experience**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (Flexible)

```javascript
// Subject selected → Scan all years for that subject
// Year added → Narrow to specific Subject+Year
// Topic added → Filter existing results
// Smart caching prevents re-scanning
```

**Pros:**
- Good balance of speed and flexibility
- Progressive refinement
- Smart caching
- Natural user flow

**Cons:**
- Multiple scanning phases
- Some redundant checks initially

## Option 3: Predictive Pre-scanning
**Strategy**: Background scanning of likely combinations
**Performance**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (Feels instant)
**User Experience**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (Smooth)

```javascript
// Pre-scan popular combinations (current year, common subjects)
// Background scanning while user interacts
// Predictive loading based on selected filters
```

**Pros:**
- Feels instant for common cases
- Background processing
- Anticipates user needs
- Smooth experience

**Cons:**
- Some unnecessary background work
- More complex logic
- May scan unused combinations

## Option 4: File System API (Modern Browsers)
**Strategy**: Direct folder access (Chrome/Edge 86+)
**Performance**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (Native speed)
**User Experience**: ⭐⭐⭐ (Requires permission)

```javascript
// Direct folder browsing via File System Access API
// Real-time folder structure detection
// No guessing about file existence
```

**Pros:**
- Native file system speed
- Real folder structure
- No HTTP requests for checking files
- Perfect accuracy

**Cons:**
- Modern browsers only
- Requires user permission
- Not suitable for web hosting
- Local use primarily

---

## Option 5: Configuration-Based
**Strategy**: JSON manifest of all questions
**Performance**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (Instant)
**User Experience**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (Smooth)

```javascript
// Load questions.json with complete file listing
// Instant filtering and display
// No file existence checking needed
```

**Pros:**
- Instant loading
- Perfect reliability
- Rich metadata support
- Advanced search capabilities

**Cons:**
- Manual config maintenance
- Must update JSON when adding files
- Extra step in workflow

---

## Option 6: Hybrid Approach
**Strategy**: Combine multiple methods with intelligent fallbacks
**Performance**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (Adaptive)
**User Experience**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (Best of all)

```javascript
// Try File System API → fallback to config → fallback to smart scanning
// Adaptive based on browser capabilities
// Best performance for each scenario
```

**Pros:**
- Best performance in all scenarios
- Future-proof design
- Graceful degradation
- Optimal user experience

**Cons:**
- Most complex implementation
- Larger codebase
- More testing required
